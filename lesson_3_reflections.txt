When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   so other people can see it. also so you dont lose it. the whole point of
   github is ot share resources.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   you may be making changes that fuck your program up. additionally, you my
   nnot end up with commits at logical intervals. again,
   using git for version control seems to center around logic and discretion,
   and auto-pulling would go against that.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

   forks are you branching off from another persons repository on github. llike
   any branch, what you do continues from their shit, but it does not affect
   their shit. only yours. however, all the commits are there. clones are
   duplicates containing all the commit history. and can be on github or your
   computer. brahcnes are you moving in a different direction from your last
   commit on your own repository, but at the same time not altering the master
   because you're playing around or creating another version that should exist.
