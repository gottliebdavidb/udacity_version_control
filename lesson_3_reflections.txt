When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   so other people can see it. also so you dont lose it. the whole point of github is ot share resources. 
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   you may be making changes that fuck your program up. additionally, you my nnot end up with commits at logical intervals. again,
   using git for version control seems to center around logic and discretion, and auto-pulling would go against that.
